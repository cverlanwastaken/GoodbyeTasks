GoodbyeTasks

This is a simple desktop application that provides helpful daily tasks to the user. When the user clicks the "Get Daily Task" button, a variety of random tasks appear on the screen, reminding healthy habits such as washing hands, drinking water, eating food, and more. The goal is to encourage the user to develop healthy and beneficial habits throughout the day. Tasks change every time the button is clicked, so the application offers different suggestions each time.
